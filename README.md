# Advent of Code - Solutions to the Problems

## Installation
Install the requirements (only needed for the solutions for a few specific days):

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

For each solution `DayXX.py` you want to run, include the following two files in the corresponding folder:
- `DayXX_sample.dat`: contains the sample data for the exercise, as given on the public web page of Advent of Code
- `DayXX_input.dat`: contains your unique user-specific input data for the exercise, as given on the web page of Advent of Code after you are logged in

## Run the Solution Files
Simply navigate to the folder containing the solution you want to run, then execute

`python DayXX.py {part} {inputType}`

where `part={1,2}` stands for part 1 or 2 of the problem and `inputType={s,r}` stands for the sample input (`s`) or real input (`r`) file.

For example, if you want to run part 2 the solution for day 2 of the 2024 version of Advent of Code for the real input data, execute

`python Day02.py 2 r`
